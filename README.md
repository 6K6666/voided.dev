# website
big thank you to https://github.com/yuwui for helping with the site | source for my website @ voided.dev 

.css has a cache exception set by IIS because IIS was giving me shit and making it hard for me to see my edits to the stylesheet in real time so feel free to delete web.config if it's not useful for you
